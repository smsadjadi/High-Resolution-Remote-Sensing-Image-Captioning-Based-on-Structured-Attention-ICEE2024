# Loss Module

The **loss** folder in this repository contains a custom loss module named `loss.py`, which is an essential component of the project's neural network model. This module defines and implements various loss functions that contribute to the training process of the model. The custom loss module is designed to enhance the training process by incorporating additional regularization terms that are specific to the remote sensing image captioning task.

## Module Overview

The `loss_function.py` module contains the following components:

### `custum_loss` Class

This class defines a custom loss function as an extension of `nn.Module`. The loss function is designed to be used with neural network models for remote sensing image captioning. The class includes the following methods:

- **`__init__`**: Initializes an instance of the `custum_loss` class. It initializes the base loss as the CrossEntropyLoss, a commonly used loss function for classification tasks.

- **`DSR`**: Calculates the Doubly Stochastic Regularization (DSR) loss term. This term encourages a form of structured attention by penalizing deviations from the expected attention distribution.

- **`AVR`**: Calculates the Attention Variance Regularization (AVR) loss term. This term encourages attention values to have low variance, promoting stability in the attention mechanism.

- **`forward`**: Computes the overall loss for the model. It combines the base loss with the optional DSR and AVR terms, applying scaling factors to each term.

### Loss Regularization Terms

The custom loss module introduces two distinct regularization terms:

- **Doubly Stochastic Regularization (DSR)**: Encourages the attention distribution to be balanced and structured by penalizing deviations from a uniform attention distribution.

- **Attention Variance Regularization (AVR)**: Promotes stable attention values by minimizing the variance among attention values.

## Usage

To utilize the `custum_loss` class, follow these steps:

1. Import the class from `loss.py` in your training script.
2. Initialize an instance of the `custum_loss` class.
3. Use the loss function during your training loop by passing appropriate arguments such as predicted outputs, ground truth labels, attention tensors, and region counts.

Example code snippet:

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim
from loss.loss import custum_loss

# Initialize the custom loss function
loss_function = custum_loss()

# Inside the training loop
for batch_data in dataloader:
    # Forward pass
    predicted = model(batch_data)
    
    # Calculate loss
    loss = loss_function(predicted, ground_truth, attention, Region_count)
    
    # Backpropagation and optimization
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```
